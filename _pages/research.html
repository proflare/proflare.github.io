                <p>Theme 1: Improving Charge Transfer in Organic Photovoltaic Cells</p>
            </div>
            <p>Among various renewable energy technologies, solar photovoltaics appear as one of the most promising, especially in Africa where the resource is relatively abundant. However, it remains relatively expensive due to dominant silicon technologies. Our research aims to contribute to resolving challenges faced by organic photovoltaic cells, particularly charge transfer at electrode/organic material interfaces.</p>
