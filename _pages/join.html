        <h1>Join My Research Group</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Thank you for your interest in joining my research group! Before you reach out via email, please carefully review the following expectations and qualifications I set for prospective members of my team.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Qualifications:</h2>
            <h3>1. Self-Motivation and Persistence:</h3>
            <p>As your advisor, my role is to steer you in the right direction; however, the responsibility to drive your research projects to completion rests with you. You will have the autonomy to shape and advance your research, under my guidance.</p>

            <h3>2. Mathematical Maturity:</h3>
            <p>You should be adept at formulating rigorous mathematical questions, designing algorithms, and proving theorems. Comfort with writing and understanding proofs and the ability to grasp complex mathematical concepts is crucial. At a minimum, you should have a solid foundation in linear algebra, basic probability, statistics, and algorithms.</p>

            <h3>3. Coding Proficiency:</h3>
            <p>Experience in programming is essential, preferably in multiple languages. While the specific languages are less critical, experience in both lower-level languages (for efficiency) and higher-level scripting languages (like Python or MATLAB) is highly valued.</p>

            <p>It's not necessary to be an expert in both mathematics and coding, but you should demonstrate a competent level of skill and a keen interest in at least one of these areas.</p>

            <h2>Working with Me:</h2>
            <p>Most of my current students come from the following schools (<a href="https://univ-lome.tg/universite/organisation/fds">FDS</a>; <a href="https://univ-lome.tg/universite/ecoles/ensi">ENSI</a>; <a href="https://www.campus-togo.com/universite-de-kara-uk/faculte-sciences-techniques-fast/">FAST</a>; <a href="https://wascal.org/category/togo/">WASCAL</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/%C3%A9cole-polytechnique-de-lom%C3%A9-ul/posts/?feedView=all">EPL</a>) , however, I am open to international collaboration as well. If you believe you meet these qualifications and are interested in conducting research under my guidance, please send me an email. In your message, explain why you are particularly interested in working with me, citing specific research topics or publications of mine that motivate you. While it is common to contact multiple professors, personalized communications that reflect genuine interest and understanding of my work will stand out more than generic template messages.</p>
